# Tests

This directory contains unit tests based on the test case infrastructure of DAX.sim. The test case classes of DAX.sim
are an extension of the standard Python `unittest` classes and therefore integrate seamlessly with existing software
tools for testing. DAX.sim allows users to construct ARTIQ environments and test the state of devices during simulation.

This is inherited from the dax_example, but may have new components as well
